# LIBTwinSVM

## Core Features
LIBTwinSVM is an easy-to-use implementation of Twin Support Vector Machine.  It is licensed under the terms of GNU GPL v3. This application comes with a user interface which makes using the algorithm so handy for Data Scientists, Machine Learning Researchers and whoever else that is interested in Machine Learning.

You can read some of its core features below:
- A **simple** and **user-friendly Graphical User Interface** (GUI) for running TwinSVM Classifier.
- Easy to import data in **CSV** & **LIBSVM** format.
- Loading data with **shuffling** and **normalizing** ability.
- **Fast optimization algorithm**: The clipDCD algorithm was improved and is implemented in **C++** for solving optimization problems of TwinSVM.
- Supporting **Linear**, **RBF kernel** and **Rectangular**.
- Supporting **Binary** and **Multi-class** classification (One-vs-All & One-vs-One).
- The OVO estimator is **compatible with sci-kit-learn** tools such as GridSearchCV, cross_val_score, etc.
- The classifier can be evaluated using either **K-fold cross-validation** or **Training/Test split**.
- It supports **grid search** over C and gamma parameters.
- **Saving** the detailed classification result in an **Excel-format spreadsheet** file in the custom location.
- **Keeping log** of the entire training session to keep track of best training results.
